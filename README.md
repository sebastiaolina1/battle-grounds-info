How to use it? Add this project to your list of projects in the latest version of Unity and use "build" to initialize the game.
Who created it, how, and why? It was entirely created by me.
I used Unity and focused on learning C#, then I looked at Unity's functions and rules.
I created it to relive that classic nostalgic moment from years ago when you and your brother, cousin, or friends were playing a game on an old console with an old gamepad. This project only works using the keyboard for player 1 and the PlayStation 2 USB gamepad for player 2.
