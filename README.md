How to use it? Add this project to your list of projects in the latest version of Unity and use "build" to initialize the game.
Who created it, how, and why? It was entirely created by me.
I used Unity and focused on learning C#, then I looked at Unity's functions and rules.
I created it to relive that classic nostalgic moment from years ago when you and your brother, cousin, or friends were playing a game on an old console with an old gamepad. This project only works using the keyboard for player 1 and the PlayStation 2 USB gamepad for player 2.
The controls are: 'W' to go forward, 'A' to go left, 'S' to go backward, 'D' to go right, use the mouse to move the camera, use 'Q' to dash, press 'F' to defend, use 'space' to jump, and click the left mouse button to punch. The controls for the PlayStation 2 controller are: 'Left analog stick' to walk, 'Right analog stick' to move the camera, 'R1' or 'R2' to dash, 'X' to jump, 'circle' to attack, press 'square' to defend, and click the left analog stick to focus on the enemy.
As previously mentioned, this is my first game, using this engine and programming language, and it was truly challenging and stressful to learn something as difficult as 3D so quickly. Therefore, I ask that you take this into consideration, and I hope that many people can use this as a starting point.
